Changes in Version 1.1-0

  o Fixed diagonal matrix computations in gstslshet(). Due to incorrect
 trace computations, prior versions could lead to erroneous results.
 However, for the Boston data in Piras (2009) - see the vignette for more
 details - only slight differences occur.

Details:

The old command line
R> gammas<-as(Diagonal(,as.vector(gamma)),"sparseMatrix")
in the function gstslshet() was producing incorrect results in the computation of the following trace term (for R versions newer than 2.9.0):
R> tr1<-sum(diag(A1A1t%*%gammas%*%A1A1t%*%gammas))/2
For the Boston data results are only slightly different from those in Piras (2009) 
(see sphet vignette for greater details).
With different data, differences could be quite large. 


  o added the zero.policy option as in spdep
  
  o impacts() calculation for objects of class "sphet"


Changes in Version 1.2-0

  o Added the function spreg to match stata and GeoDa. 


Changes in Version 1.4-0

  o Read the instrument and endogenous variable from the data
  
Changes in Version 1.4-1

  o fix the residuals for model without intercept. 
  
  o put options for minimizations under control = list()
  
  o solve a problem with the HAC. In particular there are now four options (see help).  
  
  
Changes in Version 1.4-2

  o fix a serious of issues with the instruments. 
  
  o endog and instruments are now either NULL or a formula type of object

Changes in Version 1.4-3

  o intImpacts was exported from spdep on revision 530 on R-forge. Therefore, there are no more warning 
  when trying to access that function. 

  o loading much faster due to changes in spdep 
  
  o Replaced fields::rdist.earth with sp::spDists, which avoids importing from fields and provide a more accurate computation of the distance. In fact, 
  rdist.earth used a spheroid and spDists an ellipsoid (WGS84) for Great Circle distances.
 
  
  o loading much faster due to changes in spdep 

Changes in Version 1.6-2

  o Change in two W suggested by users
